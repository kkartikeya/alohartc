`color` is a package for efficiently converting between different video color
formats. Currently, one conversion is supported, namely YUYV (also known as
YUY2) to YUV420P.

YUYV is a packed format frequently produced by MIPI-CSI and USB Video Class
(UVC) cameras. YUV420P is a planar format ubiquitously supported by H.264
decoders.
